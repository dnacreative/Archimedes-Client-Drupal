= Installation =
You'll need the php archimedes library to use this module that can be found at
https://github.com/fiasco/Archimedes-Library. Click on the Downloads button and
select a compression format to download. Unpack the file and copy the
archimedes.class.php file from the php directory into the root directory of the
archimedes module.

Alternately you can just do:
  wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/fiasco/Archimedes-Library/raw/master/php/archimedes.class.php
Which will download the PHP archimedes class right from the master branch.
